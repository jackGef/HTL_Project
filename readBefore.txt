The project of H.T.L

Hello.
I made all of the asked functions exept one that i did not finish
The one i didn't finish is the trimVidep function 
i have a problem with that that i tried to fix for something like a day or even more but didn't secceed 
so after i made the function i gave chatGPT to create the function but his functoin didn't work either

I left both mine and chatCPT functions in the main.cpp file 
The funciton hase a red command above that indicates wich one is mine and wich one is chatGPT 

Hope i made the function correctly

Explanation of main.cpp file:
    in the main function i made a declaration to convert the mp4 to an AVI format
    after that  ther is a loop that let you choose what function will be used
    All the funcitons use the reformat video file (.avi | expaet the convert fucntio ofcourse)


I uploaded the files without the build files so type this command to make the build files
command to start the building process:
    cmake -B ./build/ -G "Visual Studio 17 2022"

after you started the build process type this command to compile the main.cpp file
compile command:
    cmake --build ./build/

after that run this command to start the main function in the main.cpp file
command to run the project:
    .\build\Debug\HTL_Project_ort.exe C:\Users\jack\Desktop\HTL_project_ort\videos\mp4\video.mp4 C:\Users\jack\Desktop\HTL_project_ort\videos\AVI\convertedVideo.avi
